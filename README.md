# Reproducible Analyses for Bioinformatics (Rabix)

## Editors
The purpose of the Rabix editors is to implement a graphical user interface for describing tools in the [Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/). They were originally written as an open source project, now referred to as [rabix.org](https://www.rabix.org/), as a single application. They have since been decoupled from one another and integrated into the SevenBridges and the Cancer Genomics Cloud platforms.

The CWL specification which these editors currently support is [draft-2](http://www.commonwl.org/draft-2/). Future iterations should support CWL 1.0 when it is finalized. The two editors are the Command Line Tool Editor (Cliche) and the Workflow Editor (Dyole).

Cliche is used to edit Command Line Tools and could once edit Expression Tools, but this functionality has been dropped. Dyole edits Workflows through an SVG based graphical editor.
